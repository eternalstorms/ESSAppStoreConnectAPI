If @c loggedIn == NO and @c needsTwoFactorAuth == YES, you need to finish 2FA first (see @c -loginWithUsername:password:completionHandler:'s discussion).

If @c loggedIn is NO and @c needsTwoFactorAuth is YES, the info dictionary contains the following keys: "securityCode" (a dictionary containing code info), "phoneNumbers" (an array of dictionaries describing the trusted phone numbers), "didSendCode" (whether an auth code was already sent or not), "wasTrustedDeviceCode" (whether the code was sent via push to a trusted device or SMS to a trusted phone number), "scnt" and "AppleIDSessionID" (two Apple-specific, opaque strings)
